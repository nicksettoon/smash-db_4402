Repo for semester project for Intro to Database Management Systems

Project Objectives

Esports is one of the most rapidly growing sports in the world right now. This form of 
entertainment and competition expands across the globe, and the world’s best come together to 
compete in epic battles and showcase their skills. One of the more popular of the different 
esports games is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game lets players choose any one of the 74 
characters. These characters come from Nintendo’s most popular games including the Mario 
Bros. Series, Pokemon, and Legend of Zelda Series. The esports player chooses their favorite 
character to battle one another in a fight for survival. The esport tournaments consist of players 
battling in a double elimination style bracket with a best-of-five or best-of-three series deciding 
who to crown the best Super Smash Bros. Ultimate player.  Between character attributes and 
player statistics there is a lot of data to be accounted for. Our group plans to tackle and sort a 
large proportion of this data and store it in a database to make for an easy and organized view of 
results. In all, our project objective is to create an efficient, consistent, and scalable database to 
answer any user request regarding all of the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate data we collect.
Business Requirements
The database must be formatted in a way that can satisfy these requirements by the user.
* We need the database to correctly determine who has a better head to head matchup between two esports players.
* The database must be able to account for the increase in growth of entries as the popularity of the sport continues to grow.
* Determine which player has the most  tournament wins.
* Which fictional character has the most wins.
* When two characters are paired up against each other who has the advantage, no matter who the esports players are.
* Is there such a thing as clutch in esports? Which player has the most wins when facing elimination.
* Which player has the most series sweeps.
